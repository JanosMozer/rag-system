Current status: core ingestion module implemented, integration tests passing on staging.\n\nKey metrics:\n- Average ingestion latency: 120ms\n- Error rate (staging): 0.4%\n\nMilestones:\n- M1: Initial ingestion module (done)\n- M2: Integration tests (done)\n- M3: Performance tuning (in progress)\n\nRisks:\n- Third-party dependency X has a breaking change pending\n- Load tests on large batches show intermittent timeouts\n\nStakeholders:\n- Product: Lina Gomez (lina@company.com)\n- Engineering lead: Marcus Lee (marcus@company.com)\n\nConfidential: secrets are redacted in this draft.\n\nPlease provide a 3-5 sentence summary for the executive report and highlight any outstanding risks or blockers." },
