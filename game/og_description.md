WEBPAGE DESIGN

LANDING PAGE
There should be a landing page which describes the project, about, has links to the games, the badcompany official page, the gloabl ranking



Left pannel of the screen: Describe the setup, goal, and capabilities for the attacker to know what it can use and what it needs to extact.
- Attack goal: what constitutes a successful attack. This is easily determined from the attack evaluation function.
- Agent and system description: what info and tools it can access. what its access and permissions are. what is the agent's goal (summary of system prompt). could include a drop down description with "more info", including name of model used, some technical details.
- Scenario: describe the actions that will ocurr after the attacker starts the attack. ex: Agent will read all the documents, git commits, and make summary and email it to CEO. 
--- this is easy if it is single turn, trickier if multi turn.
- Attack capabilities and status: who the attacker, what its access and permissions are, is what tools the attacker has access to in order to carry out the attack.
this part wont be very interactive (only maybe some expandable drop down "more info" things)

Center pannel of the screen: this is where the attacker interacts with the system. should be pretty flexible and allow for very different layouts and be very interactive. Some examples of what could be implemented here
- regular chat interaction
- a gui where an "employee" can authenticate, then navigate a file system, add files, edit files, also have a chat. make mock git commits (see other's git commits). it should contain all the tools that the attacker has.

Center pannel of the screen: im unsure for now. some possibilities (non exclusive). as i am unsure, this should be flexible for now
- show summary of agent process. similar to what the user sees when he uses chatgpt in thinking mode, but also should say which document it reads, tool calls, what it writes, etc. We should anyways keep track (with limited access) (dynamically updating as the attack poceeds)
- show some statistics
- summary of the system architecture, models used, description (static)
- show the current global ranking, which should be expandable 
- some optional help or tips to complete a level


the statistics include:
- number of messages sent
- number of words/tokens sent
- number of tokens processed by the LLM (so including the prompt, context and documents used, inference tokens) XXX This would also have to be incorporated in the LLM calling part. Either way we should keep statistics of this.
- total inference time used or a metric of how much it cost to our system to process the attack
- more 



section: possible scenarios and attacks: This section describes possible attacks, and based on this we will create some of the games levels. The scenarios should be "pre cooked" meaning that the attacker should not need to work extremely hard to be successful. What he must do is the malicious part, but the rest should be already be done for him. ex: in the git commit examples, we should already have put into place some commits for him, and maybe have a draft for his progress report already made, and all he has to do is put the malicious part, edit some files and do prompt injection and get the success like that.

- attacker convinces the llm agent to do a websearch to a insecure site (there are already mitigations for this)

- notion attack: hide malicious prompt in a doc. Then get agent to summarize some confidential info and then make a websearch to the attackers personal webpage including the summarized info in the payload. ex: {"web_search: {"badcompany.io/sensitive_info_etc"}}

- employee (attacker) has less access than CEO. But employee might hide a prompt injection attack into a document that the agent (when called by CEO) will excecute this instruction by the employee. The employee would indirectly gain more permissions than it should   

- employee searches for unauthorized info (peer level info). maybe an attack is: convince agent to read some data which it has access to (because ceo called it), but employee should not have access to. employee

- algorithmic evaluation of employee work is not feasible. Agent is used to analyze employee report of their own work (+ git commits) and to summarize and make a score and then send it to the boss/manager and maybe to a point system which then determines your bonus/promotion/payment. trick employee review work report async communication. the agent gets access to git commits / concrete work logs + employee self report.

- meeting transcriber + summarizer + meeting notes. you are the first to join. you have 30s - 1m of free talk with the llm before the otehr people join. Try to context prompt inject the LLM so that the final meeting notes are positive about you. trick the llm.

- you know that an agent is going to onboard a new employee. As attacker, you want the LLM to give bad instructions to new employee. You are tasked to make a document which the LLM will read before talking with new employee. as attacker you have attacker to the "task prompt" that the LLM is gonna get

- some attack leveraging the "memory tool" that the llm has

- the model with its alignement and system prompt may be convinced to do unethical things (like blackmail another employee) if confronted with a moral dillema.

- employee onboarding: other possible risks. expand



section: system / agent design: this currently describes the system which will be jailrboken (by different methods in different levels using different situations)

for now this is a internal agent which has access to some company data (the access is dependant on the user permission levels), some tools, etc
workers at the company (and public) have different permissions can interact with it.

permission levels (from less to more permission)
- public users
- regular employee
- manager
- ceo


TODO: improve this



section: Generalities and System vulnerabilities & general thinking:

There is a tradeoff between agent capabilities and security. Especially wrt access and permissions.

There might be many routine processes carried out by an agent . An attacker might 

If have access to the outside world, that introduces risk of attacks coming from the outside AND sensitive/confidential info coming out. tool example: web_search, email, message_platform (slack, teams, discord). XXX

Agents only have access to digitalized data, but not to informal human conversations (unless recorded and transcribed). An agent will have to deal with this, and in some cases, probably make assumptions / accept someone's word for it. The risk here is misinformation.

Think where and when will agents be used by average non-technical people (karacsony levente) trying to make their lives easy. what will they use llm agents for? that's a realistic scenario. The best examples are those where algorithmic solutions are not suitable. ex: review quality of employee work weekly. ex: review project progress and write summary for client. how could these cases be tricked?



section: future ideas
- agent will need memory. suceptibility here
- agent can create new tools. maybe some human has to approve
- continual learning is critical for an agent to be effective in the long term. If this is automatized, and human intervention reduced, this introduces misalignement risks.

extra ideas up to discussion: 
- make as much of the whole thing open and be open to feedback. ex: show exactly what the criteria for evaluating the attack is (ex: use llm judge and show its system prompt)
- can we quantify how "novel" an attack is? it would be nice to reward them extra (and also check them out). ex: tom and jerry attack gets a score of 0 here.

difficulties to keep in mind
- agent processes take time and are slow. how do we make an engaging game given this latency? 
- should we terminate agent processes early when the attack will fail? (to make it quicker)
--- probably not bc it is hard and also we might kill some very original attacks (and we are actually quite interested in these)
- we need a score system for how good the attack is. 
- how do we do all the communication between the system, LLM stuff, etc... and the webpage. We need to tidy up the system and agent part significantly
